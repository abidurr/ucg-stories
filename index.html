      <h2>Hello, friend.</h2>
      <p>
        UCG has left me with many wonderful memories, and I am guessing it has
        been good to you as well. But as the days go by and we accumulate new
        experiences, it is fair to say that those memories will start to blur.
        In order to preserve some of the great times we have shared, I thought
        of making this site as a little side project (since I am currently
        learning web dev). With this site I hope we can record some of the times
        we shared, before we start forgetting the details. If I get enough
        responses, I will compile them into a PDF and share them with you. Feel
        free to use the <a href="write.html">Write</a> section to share some of
        the memories you have made during your time in Groningen. Maybe it was a
        sweet day you'd like to remember. Maybe it was a party. Maybe you wanted
        to tell someone that they were cool but didn't get the chance to do so
        explicitly. Maybe it is a reflection (in typical UCG fashion) on your
        time in Groningen. Whatever it is that you want to share. Stories can be
        written anonymously, so feel free to pour your heart out. Word counts
        are irrelevant. And in any case, thanks for taking the time to visit.
        Peace and love :)
